\section{Introduction}

The need to deal with three-dimensional stellar models comes from the common
situation where the large scales of a star do not own any symmetry. Typically
that occurs when the star own a large-scale magnetic field with no special
symmetry of if the star  in the gravitational field of another massive object.
In the general case the situation is even more complex since the star is
usually not in a steady state: a variable tidal potential is a common case.
