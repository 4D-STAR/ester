{"name":"Ester","tagline":"Evolution STEllaire en Rotation","body":"ESTER is available under the GPL Version 3 license.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of this project is to set out a two-dimensional stellar evolution\r\ncode, which fully takes into account the effects of rotation, at any rate and in\r\na self-consistent way. The difficult, but important point is that rotating stars\r\nare spheroidal and are never in hydrostatic equilibrium. They are pervaded by\r\nflows everywhere, even in the stably stratified radiative regions. These flows\r\nare essentially convective flows in thermally unstable regions (convection\r\nzones) and baroclinic flows in the radiative regions. These latter flows are\r\ngrosso modo a differential rotation and a meridional circulation, with likely\r\nsome small-scale turbulence. Radiative regions of non-rotating stars experience\r\nvery little mixing (only due to microscopic phenomena). Rotation induces flows\r\nand therefore some mixing, well-known as \"rotational mixing\". This is a key\r\nfeature of the evolution of rotating stars. Besides, these stars also oscillate,\r\nand astronomers would like to get from the oscillation frequencies some good\r\nconstraints on the structure of these stars. The foregoing reasons and many\r\nothers motivated us to construct a two-dimensional model of rotating stars that\r\nis kind enough to enlight us on the numerous questions we are wondering about...\r\nPlease send any question or comment to ester-project@googlegroups.com.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
